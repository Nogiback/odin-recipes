        <p>How to make the croutons:</p>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350˚F. Cut the baguette in half lengthwise through the top of the baguette then slice diagonally into 1/4" thick pieces. Place the breads onto a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine 3 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil and 1 tsp of finely minced garlic. Drizzle the garlic oil over the croutons and sprinkle the top with 2 Tbsp grated parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Toss until evenly coated. Spread in a single layer over the baking sheet and bake at 350˚F until light golden and crisp (10-12 minutes), or to desired crispness.</li>
        <p>How to make the dressing:</p>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together garlic, dijon, Worcestershire, lemon juice and red wine vinegar.</li>
        <li>Slowly drizzle in extra virgin olive oil while whisking constantly.</li>
        <li>Whisk in 1/2 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp black pepper, or season to taste.</li>
        <p>How to make the salad:</p>
        <li>Rinse, dry and chop or tear the romaine into bite-sized pieces. Place in a large serving bowl and sprinkle generously with shredded parmesan cheese and cooled croutons. Drizzle with caesar dressing and toss gently until lettuce is evenly coated.</li>
